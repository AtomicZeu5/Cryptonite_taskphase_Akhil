# PRACTICIING PIPING
Because these three channels are used so frequently in Linux, they are known by shorter names: stdin, stdout, stderr. This module will teach you how to redirect, chain, block, and otherwise mess with these channels.

### 6.1 Redirecting output
In this challenge, we had to redirect PWN to COLLEGE file by using echo. ` echo PWN > COLLEGE` to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{867-pSoeNPYYeXcBu63xEhqulCi.dRjN1QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 6.2 Redirecting more output
In this challenge, we are supposed to redirect the output of `/challenge/run` to `myflag` file. Executing `/challenge/run > myflag` will satisfy all the requirements. Now we use `cat /myflag` to read out the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{Qm3PWc26US-8ZDefnMkAhjoIS_U.dVjN1QDL3cTN0czW
```

## 6.3 Appending output
In this challenge, we use the append `>>` instead of the `>` to get the flag. It clearly specifies to use `>>`. If we used `>`, the second aprt of the flag will overwrite the first half. We type `/challenge/run >> /home/hacker/the-flag`. Which will satisfy all the conditions and then we read the file by `cat /home/hacker/the-flag`.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{4qilAR3zGKevRXJWM4DY4IS_WEW.ddDM5QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 6.4 Redirecting errors
We type `/challenge/run > myflag 2> instructions` to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{MtjrfbK0JGuz4cyAwVw-sIn7jh2.ddjN1QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 6.5 Redirecting input
In this challenge, we have to first input COLLEGE into PWN by `echo COLLEGE > PWN`. Then, we direct this to /challenge/run by `/challenge/run < PWN` to gett he flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{EySVGdE5850z6wwY_FBKjn0dBpo.dBzN1QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 6.6 Grepping stored results

FIrst, we use `/challenge/run > /tmp/data.txt` to output the data to /tmp/data.txt. It gives us a success page so we proceed by greping the file for the flag. We know the flag starts with "pwn" so we use `grep pwn /tmp/data.txt` to find the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{QfLsjv9ys3fWBOZNw7Xywzb6gaT.dhTM4QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 6.7 Grepping live output
We execute `challenge/run | grep pwn` to search and find the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{YccHbv0SLuWRfhvd9grVGEFdEx9.dlTM4QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 6.8 Grepping errors

To get the flag as instructed, we combine `/challenge/run 2>&1`  and `| grep pwn.college` as `/challenge/run 2>&1 | grep pwn.college` to get the output of the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{4VcqeR-Qwy7THFpQ1iets8EDs2K.dVDM5QDL3cTN0czW}
```
## 6.9 Duplicating piped data with tee

To get the flag, we first type the command `/challenge/pwn | tee output | /challenge/college` and then `cat output` to determine the secret command. The secret command was 8jRkQOWE for me so I executed `/challenge/pwn --secret 8jRkQOWE | /challenge/college` to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{8jRkQOWEfvAnPl6b-bcOPUa9-KX.dFjM5QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 6.10 Writing to multiple programs

In this challenge, we are asked to Run the /challenge/hack command, and duplicate its output as input to both the /challenge/the and the /challenge/planet commands. We know that using >() is Process substitution, which will namely input the file. As we are supposed to input this to two of the files. we can use `tee` command as well. So, combined with the above cases, We use `/challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) | /challenge/planet` to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{kfGLZ04tJiMziSA_gKYg_CXatG3.dBDO0UDL3cTN0czW}
```
