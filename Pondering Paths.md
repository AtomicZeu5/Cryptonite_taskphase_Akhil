# Pondering Paths

This module will teach you the basics of Linux file paths! A path from the filesystem's root starts with / (that is, the root of the filesystem), and describes the set of directories that must be descended into to find the file.

## 2.1 The Root

  In this challenge, we had to invoke the pwn program using its absolute path, and we achieved this by using the `/` command. hence, we execute /pwn to get the flag.


  ### Flag
  ```
  pwn.college{EsLlv5qGEozMbT47a5uu9O2S_v1.dhzN5QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 2.2 Program and absolute paths

  In this challenge, we had to execute `run` , which is in the `challenge` directory. However, we had to invoke this by using an absolute path which can be done with `/`. Hence, we run the command /challenge/run to get the flag.

  ### Flag
  ```
   pwn.college{4eHhkMUUr9OUV-EgZN0AGDgfsbD.dVDN1QDL3cTN0czW}
```
