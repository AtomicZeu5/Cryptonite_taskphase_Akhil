# Comprehending Commands

This module introduces us to documentation The correct usage of programs depends, in a large part, in the proper specification of arguments to them. Recall the -a of ls -a in the hidden files challenge of the Basic Commands module: that -a was an argument that told ls to list out hidden files as well as non-hidden files. Because we wanted to list out hidden files, invoking ls with the -a argument was the correct way to use it in our scenario.

### 4.1 Learning from Documentation

In this challenge, we are supposed to execute `/challenge/challenge --giveflag` to get the flag.

## Flag
```
pwn.college{kRYSdL029K4SKzBN8VwfiF0Q-AH.dRjM5QDL3cTN0czW}
```

### 4.2 Learning Complex Usage

In this challenge, we are asked to execute the command `/challenge/challenge` with the argument `--printfile`. Whatever argument we give to `==printfile`, it reads out the path of that file. In this case, we need the flag which is in the `/flag` directory. hence, we type `challenge/challenge --printfile /flag` to get the flag.

## Flag
```
pwn.college{gwwYzX7AHQWF1Buld7Fc_ssSdEA.dVjM5QDL3cTN0czW}
```

### 4.3 Reading Manuals

We are told that using the `man` command will give us a total manual about the particular argument. We are asked to execute `man challenge` , which gives us this:
```
CHALLENGE(1)                                                                  Challenge Commands                                                                 CHALLENGE(1)

```
Seeing this, we observe that `/challenge/challenge` will print the flag. However, in the description, it states that it will pring the flag only if it has the argument `--eyxbfw 669` , hence, we execute `/challenge/challenge --eyxbfw 669` to get the flag.

## Flag

### 4.4 Searching manuals

In this challenge, we are introduced to the search feature in manuals. This works exactly like how Ctrl+F works in a browser page. When I executed `man challenge`, it would print the flag only if the right argument is given to /challenge/challenge. I then typed `/` to enter search and searched `print` first. I only got 2 which were not the right ones. I then searched `flag`. Then, I went through the various pages using `n` and found the right argument, which was `--logv`.I then pressed `q` to exit the search menu. Hence, the final command was `/challenge/challenge --logv`

## Flag
