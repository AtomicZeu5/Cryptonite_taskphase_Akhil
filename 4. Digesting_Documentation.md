# Comprehending Commands

This module introduces us to documentation The correct usage of programs depends, in a large part, in the proper specification of arguments to them. Recall the -a of ls -a in the hidden files challenge of the Basic Commands module: that -a was an argument that told ls to list out hidden files as well as non-hidden files. Because we wanted to list out hidden files, invoking ls with the -a argument was the correct way to use it in our scenario.

### 4.1 Learning from Documentation

In this challenge, we are supposed to execute `/challenge/challenge --giveflag` to get the flag.

## Flag
```
pwn.college{kRYSdL029K4SKzBN8VwfiF0Q-AH.dRjM5QDL3cTN0czW}
```

### 4.2 Learning Complex Usage

In this challenge, we are asked to execute the command `/challenge/challenge` with the argument `--printfile`. Whatever argument we give to `==printfile`, it reads out the path of that file. In this case, we need the flag which is in the `/flag` directory. hence, we type `challenge/challenge --printfile /flag` to get the flag.

### 4.3 Reading Manuals

We are told that using the `man` command will give us a total manual about the particular argument. We are asked to execute `man challenge` , which gives us this:
```
CHALLENGE(1)                                                                  Challenge Commands                                                                 CHALLENGE(1)

```
Seeing this, we observe that `/challenge/challenge` will print the flag. However, in the description, it states that it will print the flag only if it has the argument `--eyxbfw 669` , hence, we execute `/challenge/challenge --eyxbfw 669` to get the flag.

### 4.4 Searching manuals

In this challenge, we are introduced to the search feature in manuals. This works exactly like how Ctrl+F works in a browser page. When I executed `man challenge`, it would print the flag only if the right argument is given to /challenge/challenge. I then typed `/` to enter search and searched `print` first. I only got 2 which were not the right ones. I then searched `flag`. Then, I went through the various pages using `n` and found the right argument, which was `--logv`.I then pressed `q` to exit the search menu. Hence, the final command was `/challenge/challenge --logv`

### 4.5 Searching for Manuals

In this challenge, we open `man man`. This gives us few commands like `man -k`. Googling this reveals that this is used to search for specific keywords in manuals. We then type `man -k challenge` , this takes us to qpxhffyplm, which tells that it will print the flag. opening manual of this with `man qpxhffyplm` reveals that `--qpxhff NUM
              print the flag if NUM is 434`.
Now we run `/challenge/challenge qpxhff 434` to get the flag.

## Flag
```

```

### 4.6 Helpful Programs 
In this program, we first type `/challenge/challenge --help` as we are supposed to use the help command. This gives us the info that -p, --print-value    print the value that will cause the -g option to give you the flag.I then typed `/challenge/challenge -g` which gave e the info that [-g GIVE_THE_FLAG]. I first typed `/challenge/challenge -g` then realised that `-p` is the command. We then type `/challenge/challenge -p` which gives us a secret value which was 35 for me. Now, as we know -g is GIVE THE FLAG command, we type ` /challenge/challenge --give-the-flag 35` to get the flag.

### 4.7 Help for Builtins

In this challenge, `challenge` is a builtin command like `cd`, so we do not need to execute `/challenge/challenge` like in the ones above. We first execute `help challenge` as it tells us to and find out This builtin command will read you the flag, given the right arguments! --secret VALUE    prints the flag, if VALUE is correct
You must be sure to provide the right value to --secret. That value
 is "QfK6JK6M".

 Now, all we need to do is execute `challenge --secret QfK6JK6M` which will give us the flag.
