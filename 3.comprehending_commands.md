# Comprehending Commands

## 3.1 cat - the command
In this challenge, we are introduced to the `cat` command. cat will concatenate (hence the name) files, basically it will read out the files and multiple files if given multiple arguments. We re required to read out the file flag from the home directory, so we execute the command `cat flag` to get the flag.
