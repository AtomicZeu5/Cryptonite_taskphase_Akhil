# File Globbing

## 5.1 Matching with *
In this challenge, we are introduced to `*`. When it encounters a * character in any argument, the shell will treat it as "wildcard" and try to replace that argument with any files that match the pattern. In this challenge, we are asked to change directories but the argument after cd should be less than 4 characters. To do this, we simply type `cd /ch*` to change directories and run `/challenge/run` to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{YmXvgkEuJzRwFIswavlOz-0WxBQ.dFjM4QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 5.2 Matching with ?

In this challenge, we learn that the `?` can be used to replace only a single character. We are asked to change to `/challenge direcotry` while using `?` instead of `c` and `l`. Hence, we type `cd /?ha??enge` to change directory and execute `/challenge/run` to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{oEi3XVt7zzEbk2MLZrCW80xC3Uc.dJjM4QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 5.3 Matching with []

In this challenge, we are supposed to find only the four files given by then, which are file_b, file_a, file_s, and file_h. We first change directory to `/challenge/files` as told by them, then execute `/challenge/run file_[absh]` to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{MO10xLa6SYy22sz8OgBMIxPPTYc.dNjM4QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 5.4 Matching paths with []

In this challenge, we are supposed to run /challenge/run with a single argument which retrieving the information about files b,a,s and h. Since we know that Globbing happens on a path basis, we can type `/challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[bash]` to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{gSSr019GMyXZQhZriAQm06x0yog.dRjM4QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 5.5 Mixing globs

In this challenge, we are supposed to find the file pertaining to "challenging", "educational", and "pwning", using all the globs we have learnt until now.Firstly, i changed directories by `cd /challenge/files`. Then I typed `/challenge/run [in]*` as `in` were common letter in all 3 of the words but this expanded to `incredible nice` So then I tried using the first letters of the commands, which are `cep` so I ran `/challenge/run [cep]*` which gave me the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{sQuM2hVHX-Bt-YisuQEw9HhATg9.dVjM4QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 5.6 Exclusionary globbing
In this challenge, we are supposed to search for all files without the `pwn` characters. To do this, we first change directory into `cd /challenge/files`, then I ran `/challenge/run file_[!pwn]` which gave me the error `Error: your argument is too long! It must be 8 characters or less.`. Seeing this, I realized that instead of searching the file, I could just use `*` to search and then types`/challenge/run [!pwn]*` to get the flag.
