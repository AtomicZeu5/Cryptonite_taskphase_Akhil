# Comprehending Commands

## 3.1 cat - the command
In this challenge, we are introduced to the `cat` command. cat will concatenate (hence the name) files,basically it will read out the files and multiple files if given multiple arguments. We are required to read out the file flag from the home directory, so we execute the command `cat flag` to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{ItIqO-8d_7-AxwwP4x5gd0n2rsI.dFzN1QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 3.2 Catting absolute paths
 In this challenge, we had to get the flag using cat but the flag was at its absolute path, which was /flag. Hence, I executed `cat /flag` to get the flag.

 ### Flag
 ```
pwn.college{87wQgLD-DCuy-_8HYJtDOit-Z7X.dlTM5QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 3.3 More catting practice
In this challenge, we were told that the file was in an unknown directory and that we could not use the `cd` command. It mentioned that the flag was in the /usr/lib/pkg-config/flag directory. So, I executed `cat /usr/lib/pkg-config/flag` to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{87wQgLD-DCuy-_8HYJtDOit-Z7X.dlTM5QDL3cTN0czW}
```
## 3.4 Grepping for a needle in a haystack
In this challenge, we are introduced to the `grep` command. the grep command is used to search for particular keywords or items that are in a file which has way too many items. In this challenge, we are supposed to find the flag which is in /challenge/data.txt. We also know that the flag always starts with pwn., hence, this becomes the `SEARCHSTRING` in this case. Hence, we execute `grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt` to find the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{ckXEPiH1qWo2QrYpjzrXdOiyCU8.ddTM4QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 3.5 Listing files

In this challenge, we are introduced to the `ls` command. ls will list files in all the directories provided to it as arguments, and in the current directory if no arguments are provided. We are told that /challenge/run has been renamed a random name, we are supposed to list all the items in the `/challenge` directory and find it. We execute `ls` to list the items. 12-renamed-run-17652 was the name of the item so i executed `/challenge/12-renamed-run-17652` to get the flag.

### Flag
```  pwn.college{Q1feF2lxD7T-CTfQ3UIO07c_kZL.dhjM4QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 3.6 Touching files

In this challenge, we are supposed to create files with the `tmp` command. We have to make two files, which are /tmp/pwn and /tmp/college. To do this, `cd /tmp` and then create two files by `touch /pwn` and `touch /college`. Then we execute `/challenge/run` to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{UodEZ4ZX0IsqcbWSrd7FMIun8kA.dBzM4QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 3.7 Removing files

In this challenge, we learn that we can delete files by `rm` command. We are asked to delete a file in our home directory named `delete_me`. We execute `rm delete_me` then run `/challenge/run` to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{ot7XKqxiFEJRDozY6feV6SmhYI3.dZTOwUDL3cTN0czW
```

## 3.8 Hidden files

Here, we learn that we can use `ls -a` to view hidden files too, as using `ls` doesn't list all the files. We first `cd` into the home directory by `cd /`. Now, we use `ls -a`. We get a file called flag with some numbers. We then read this file by `cat` and then the file name to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{ot7XKqxiFEJRDozY6feV6SmhYI3.dZTOwUDL3cTN0czW
```

## 3.9 An Epic Filesystem Quest

To get the flag, we had to use the `cd`, `cat` and `ls` commands extensively going back and forth between them to get the desired flag.

CONGRATULATIONS! Your perserverence has paid off, and you have found the flag!
It is: pwn.college{4-79PzQuzwVfA-TqTFlVJjA7tZ7.dljM4QDL3cTN0czW}

## 3.9 Making directories

In this challenge, we had to make directories using the `mkdir` command. We execute `mkdir /tmp/pwn` which will create the directory, then we change our directory into /tmp/pwn by `cd /tmp/pwn`, then, write `touch college` to create the college file, then we execute `/challenge/run` to check and get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{EKN4cCxPvCxtLwxPHbXaMILDISr.dFzM4QDL3cTN0czW}
