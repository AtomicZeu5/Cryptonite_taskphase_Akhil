# Comprehending Commands

## 3.1 cat - the command
In this challenge, we are introduced to the `cat` command. cat will concatenate (hence the name) files, basically it will read out the files and multiple files if given multiple arguments. We are required to read out the file flag from the home directory, so we execute the command `cat flag` to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{ItIqO-8d_7-AxwwP4x5gd0n2rsI.dFzN1QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 3.2 Catting absolute paths
 In this challenge, we had to get the flag using cat but the flag was at its absolute path, which was /flag. Hence, I executed `cat /flag` to get the flag.

 ### Flag
 ```
pwn.college{87wQgLD-DCuy-_8HYJtDOit-Z7X.dlTM5QDL3cTN0czW}
```

## 3.3 More catting practice
In this challenge, we were told that the file was in an unknown directory and that we could not use the `cd` command. It mentioned that the flag was in the /usr/lib/pkg-config/flag directory. So, I executed `cat /usr/lib/pkg-config/flag` to get the flag.

### Flag
```
pwn.college{87wQgLD-DCuy-_8HYJtDOit-Z7X.dlTM5QDL3cTN0czW}
```
